# Design Philosophy

The user interface was designed to be **clean, spacious, and professional**, drawing inspiration from modern SaaS and productivity applications. The goal was to create a formal and intuitive experience for an engineering student.

### UI/UX Principles

* **Clarity over Clutter**: The layout uses generous whitespace and a structured hierarchy to guide the user's focus.
* **Light Theme**: A bright, high-contrast light theme was chosen for excellent readability and a professional feel.
* **Single Accent Color**: A standard, professional blue is used for all primary actions and focus states to create a consistent visual language.
* **User Feedback**: The UI provides clear feedback for all states, including a polished loading skeleton during AI generation and a congratulatory modal upon plan completion.
